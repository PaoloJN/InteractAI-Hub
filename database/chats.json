Model Installation Page: This name clearly communicates that this is a page where users can install new models or remove existing ones.\n4. Model Configuration Page: This name suggests that users can configure or customize their models on this page.\n5. Model Selection Page: This name implies that users can select and choose the models they want to use, and also implies that there may be multiple models available for selection.\n6. Model Database: This name emphasizes that the page is a database of models that users can access and manage.\n7. Model Hub: This name conveys the idea of a central location where users can find and manage their models.\n8. Model Center: This name suggests that this is the main location for managing and accessing models.\n9. Model Utility Page: This name implies that the page provides a utility or tool for managing models, such as installing, uninstalling, or configuring them.\n10. Model Menagerie: This name has a playful tone and suggests that users can manage and care for their models like they would manage a menagerie of pets.\n\nUltimately, the best name will depend on your product's brand voice, target audience, and the specific functionality of the page."
